# HCGAN （Haze-Cycle GAN）
Included here are papers `Unpaired Image-to-image Translation for Paired Hazy Image Synthesis` part of the work and the `SMOKE` dataset and the `FO-Haze` dataset.  
## Abstract
We propose the `HCGAN` model, modified from the `CycleDehaze`. It is used to synthesise paired dehazing datasets that can be used for training and validation from unpaired smoke image and clear image datasets.  
The model structure is shown in the figure
